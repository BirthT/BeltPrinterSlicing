    Computes stable orientations of a mesh and their quasi-static probabilites.

    This method samples the location of the center of mass from a multivariate
    gaussian with the mean at the center of mass, and a covariance
    equal to and identity matrix times sigma, over n_samples.

    For each sample, it computes the stable resting poses of the mesh on a
    a planar workspace and evaluates the probabilities of landing in
    each pose if the object is dropped onto the table randomly.

    This method returns the 4x4 homogeneous transform matrices that place
    the shape against the planar surface with the z-axis pointing upwards
    and a list of the probabilities for each pose.

    The transforms and probabilties that are returned are sorted, with the
    most probable pose first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh : trimesh.Trimesh
      The target mesh
    com : (3,) float
      Rhe object center of mass. If None, this method
      assumes uniform density and watertightness and
      computes a center of mass explicitly
    sigma : float
      Rhe covariance for the multivariate gaussian used
      to sample center of mass locations
    n_samples : int
      The number of samples of the center of mass location
    threshold : float
      The probability value at which to threshold
      returned stable poses

    Returns
    -------
    transforms : (n, 4, 4) float
      The homogeneous matrices that transform the
      object to rest in a stable pose, with the
      new z-axis pointing upwards from the table
      and the object just touching the table.
